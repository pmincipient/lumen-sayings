## Recent Bug Fixes Summary

### 1. Gallery Page Logic Fix
**Commit:** `368adc8` - Update gallery page logic  
**Date:** 2025-08-06  
**Author:** gpt-engineer-app[bot]

#### Problem
Gallery page was displaying all quotes regardless of user authentication status, which could expose sensitive content to unauthenticated users.

The gallery page logic was not checking user authentication status before displaying quotes.

Implemented conditional display logic based on authentication status:
